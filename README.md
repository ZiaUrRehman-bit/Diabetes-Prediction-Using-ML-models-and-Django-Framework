## Description how I do
          I am going to provide a Machine Learning based solution to predict Diabetes of the patient in real time on the bases of different attributes e.g. blood
          pressure, glucose, BMI, age and so on.
          First of all, I need the training and testing dataset of diabetes patients, and I am using kaggle website to download the data set.
          This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically
          predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. 
          The datasets consist of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the
          patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
          I am going to apply 6 to 8 ML model to check accuracy in results and then select the best model in this aspect.
### Following ML models are going to be implemented:
              →	Linear Regression
              →	Logistic Regression
              →	SVM (Support Vector Machine) Algo
              →	Decision Tree Algo
              →	Random Forest Algo
              →	Naïve Bayes Algo
#### For front end development, I will use Django framework to build Website. 
              →	Django is basically a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites.
              →	Following are the examples of big websites, which use the Django framework
                  o	YouTube
                  o	Instagram
                  o	Spotify
                  o	Dropbox, etc.
